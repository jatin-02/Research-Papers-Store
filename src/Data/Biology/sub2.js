    description:
      "Nutrigenomics is an emerging science which investigates a certain area of nutrition that uses molecular tools to search access and understand the several responses obtained through a certain diet applied between individual and population groups. The increased need for the use of personalised nutrition in patients is increasing and research is being made on its possible effects. However, research on nutrigenomics and in particular, obesity is still ongoing.",

    description:
      "Genetically diverse mouse populations are powerful tools for characterizing the regulation of the proteome and its relationship to whole-organism phenotypes. We used mass spectrometry to profile and quantify the abundance of 6,798 proteins in liver tissue from mice of both sexes across 58 Collaborative Cross (CC) inbred strains. We previously collected liver proteomics data from the related Diversity Outbred (DO) mice and their founder strains. We show concordance across the proteomics datasets despite being generated from separate experiments, allowing comparative analysis.",

      "Cell biology is fundamentally limited in its ability to collect complete data on cellular phenotypes and the wide range of responses to perturbation. Areas such as computer vision and speech recognition have addressed this problem of characterizing unseen or unlabeled conditions with the combined advances of big data, deep learning, and computing resources in the past 5 years.",
