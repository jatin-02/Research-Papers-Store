      "Nutrigenomics is an emerging science which investigates a certain area of nutrition that uses molecular tools to search access and understand the several responses obtained through a certain diet applied between individual and population groups. The increased need for the use of personalised nutrition in patients is increasing and research is being made on its possible effects.",

      "α-Thalassemia is an inherited, autosomal recessive, disorder characterized by a microcytic hypochromic anemia. It is one of the most common monogenic gene disorders in the world population. The clinical severity varies from almost asymptomatic, to mild microcytic hypochromic, and to a lethal hemolytic condition, called Hb Bart's Hydrops Foetalis Syndrome.",

    author: "Stephanie Bellmaine, Alisa Schnellbaecher, Aline Zimmer",
    year: 2020,
    description:
      "Tryptophan is one of the essential mammalian amino acids and is thus a required component in human nutrition, animal feeds, and cell culture media. However, this aromatic amino acid is highly susceptible to oxidation and is known to degrade into multiple products during manufacturing, storage, and processing.",
