    description:
      "The adult four‐chambered heart of higher vertebrates functions as a sophisticated pump, driving a pulmonary and a systemic circulation that have been separated during evolution. During cardiac development, assemblage of all the different components that make this structure functional is achieved by complex morphogenetic processes that we are just beginning to appreciate.",

    author: "Larry S. Liebovitch",
    year: 2005,
    description:
      "An impressive characteristic about eyes is their round, spherical structure. Thiscchapter explores the optical, mechanical, structural, phylogenic, and ontogenic reasons why eyes are round. This exploration is used as a starting point to describe how the different features of the eye are related to each other, and how the roundness is maintained by the inflow and outflow of fluid in the eye",

    author: "Jos´ephine Groslambert, Evgeniia Prokhorova, Ivan Ahel",
    year: 2021,
    description:
      "ADP-ribosylation is a chemical modification of macromolecules found across all domains of life and known to regulate a variety of cellular processes. Notably, it has a well-established role in the DNA damage response. While it was historically known as a post-translational modification of proteins, recent studies have shown that nucleic acids can also serve as substrates of reversible ADP-ribosylation.",
