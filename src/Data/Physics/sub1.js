      "Drugs re-purposing due to COVID-19 virus has declared a number of useful candidates for treatment and prevention of the virus. Ivermectin (IVM) has gained much popularity due to a strong background of magical applications against a broad spectrum of pathogens. The in- vitro studies of ivermectin have shown promise, the thorough clinical trials of its efficacy in the treatment and prevention of SARS-CoV-2 are still warranted.",

    description:
      "In industries such as aerospace, petrochemistry and automobile, many parts of different machines are under environment which shows high temperature and high pressure, and have their proneness to wear and corrosion. Therefore, the wear resistibility and stability under high temperature need to be further improved.",
