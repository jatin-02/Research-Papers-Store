      "Two new, low activation high entropy alloys (HEAs) TiVZrTa and TiVCrTa are studied for use as in-core, structural nuclear materials for in-core nuclear applications. Low-activation is a desirable property for nuclear reactors, in an attempt to reduce the amount of high level radioactive waste upon decommissioning, and for consideration in fusion applications.",

      "Recent developments in precision mass spectrometry of radioactive isotopes (RI) and some selected related physics subjects are reviewed. In the last decades, besides conventional technologies in RI beam experiments, mass spectrometry of short-lived nuclei has significantly boosted its performance in terms of sensitivity and precision.",

    description:
      "The purpose of this paper is to show some aspects of music therapy application in cancer care and to present the integration of music therapy program into a continuous supportive cancer care for inpatients. A cancer diagnosis is one of the most feared and serious life events that causes stress in individuals and families. Cancer disrupts social, physical and emotional well-being and results in a range of emotions, including anger, fear, sadness, guilt, embarrassment and shame.",
