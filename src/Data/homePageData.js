      description:
        "We present new results for ground-state candidate energies of Mg-rich olivine (MRO) clusters and use the binding energies of these clusters to determine their nucleation rates in stellar outflows, with particular interest in the environments of core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe). Low-lying structures of clusters (Mg2SiO4)n 2 ≤ n ≤ 13 are determined from a modified minima hopping algorithm using an empirical silicate potential in the Buckingham form.",

        year: 2021,
        description:
          "Investing in early-stage companies is incredibly hard, especially when no data are available to support the decision process. Venture capitalists often rely on gut feeling or heuristics to reach a decision, which is biased and potentially harmful. This work proposes a new data-driven framework to help investors be more effectivein selecting companies with a higher probability of success. We built upon existing interdisciplinary research and augmented it with further analysis on more than 600,000 companies over a 20-year timeframe. The resulting framework is therefore a smart checklist of 21 relevant features that may help investors to select the companies more likely to succeed.",

          "Nutrigenomics is an emerging science which investigates a certain area of nutrition that uses molecular tools to search access and understand the several responses obtained through a certain diet applied between individual and population groups. The increased need for the use of personalised nutrition in patients is increasing and research is being made on its possible effects. However, research on nutrigenomics and in particular, obesity is still ongoing.",
