    description:
      "Cryptojacking occurs when an adversary illicitly runs crypto-mining software over the devices of unaware users. This novel cybersecurity attack, that is emerging in both the literature and in the wild, has proved to be very effective given the simplicity of running a crypto-client into a target device. Several countermeasures have recently been proposed, with different features and performance, but all characterized by a host-based architecture.",
