      "Human-Robot Interaction challenges Artificial Intelligence in many regards: dynamic, partially unknown environments that were not originally designed for robots; a broad variety of situations with rich semantics to understand and interpret; physical interactions with humans that requires fine, low-latency yet socially acceptable control strategies; natural and multi-modal communication which mandates common-sense knowledge and the representation of possibly divergent mental models. This article is an attempt to characterise these challenges and to exhibit a set of key decisional issues that need to be addressed for a cognitive robot to successfully share space and tasks with a human.",

    description:
      "The problem of detecting bots, automated social media accounts governed by software but disguising as human users, has strong implications. For example, bots have been used to sway political elections by distorting online discourse, to manipulate the stock market, or to push anti-vaccine conspiracy theories that may have caused health epidemics. Most techniques proposed to date detect bots at the account level, by processing large amounts of social media posts, and leveraging information from network structure, temporal dynamics, sentiment analysis, etc.",

    author: "Francesco Corea, Giorgio Bertinetti, Enrico Maria Cervellati",
    year: 2021,
    description:
      "Investing in early-stage companies is incredibly hard, especially when no data are available to support the decision process. Venture capitalists often rely on gut feeling or heuristics to reach a decision, which is biased and potentially harmful. This work proposes a new data-driven framework to help investors be more effectivein selecting companies with a higher probability of success. We built upon existing interdisciplinary research and augmented it with further analysis on more than 600,000 companies over a 20-year timeframe. The resulting framework is therefore a smart checklist of 21 relevant features that may help investors to select the companies more likely to succeed.",
