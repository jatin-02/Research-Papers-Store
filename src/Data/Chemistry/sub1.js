      "We provide an updated view on several critical concepts of quantitative Western blotting including ratiometric analysis, normalization, validation of controls, antibodies, and detection of combined linear range. This review provides a systematic workflow to gather quantifiable and reproducible data via Western blot. Relevant to researchers intending to use Western blot technology, in basic sciences and translational biomedical research.",
