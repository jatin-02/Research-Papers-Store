    description:
      "We present new results for ground-state candidate energies of Mg-rich olivine (MRO) clusters and use the binding energies of these clusters to determine their nucleation rates in stellar outflows, with particular interest in the environments of core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe). Low-lying structures of clusters (Mg2SiO4)n 2 ≤ n ≤ 13 are determined from a modified minima hopping algorithm using an empirical silicate potential in the Buckingham form.",

    description:
      "Direct dark matter searches are promising techniques to identify the nature of dark matter particles. I describe the future of this field of research, focussing on the question of what can be achieved in the next decade. I will present the main techniques and R&D projects that will allow to build so-called ultimate WIMP detectors, capable of probing spin-independent interactions down to the unimaginably low cross section of 10−48 cm2, before the irreducible neutrino background takes over.",

      "Exoplanet discoveries since the mid-1990's have revealed an astounding diversity of planetary systems. Studying these systems is essential to understanding planetary formation processes, as well as the development of life in the universe. Unfortunately, humanity can only observe limited aspects of exoplanetary systems by telescope, and the significant distances between stars presents a barrier to in situ exploration.",
