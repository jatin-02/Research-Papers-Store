      "Considering that the propagation speed of action potentials in the brain connectome has a finite limit and that present is ill-defined in the brain we apply concepts borrowed from the theories of special and general relativity to introduce the view that time and space are tightly blended in the brain. It is shown that the brain functional and structural features can be unified through a combined brain “spacetime”.",

      "Knowledge of the capacitance for the coplanar arrangement of long conducting strips is relevant for transmission lines and micro-antenna design for communications and medical applications. More generally, the evaluation of capacitances for non-trivial geometries is of continuous interest in electrostatics since the dawn of the discipline.",
