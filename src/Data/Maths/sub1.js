      "We introduce a new framework for solving an important class of computational problems involving finite permutation groups, which includes calculating set stabilisers, intersections of subgroups, and isomorphisms of combinatorial structures. Our techniques are inspired by and generalise ‘partition backtrack’, which is the current state-of-the-art algorithm introduced by Jeffrey Leon in 1991.",

      "We show how to construct linearizations of matrix polynomials za(z)d0 + c0, a(z)b(z), a(z)+b(z) (when deg (b(z)) < deg (a(z))), and za(z)d0b(z)+c0 from linearizations of the component parts, a(z) and b(z). This allows the extension to matrix polynomials of a new companion matrix construction.",
