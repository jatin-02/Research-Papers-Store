      "The optimization of fare systems in public transit allows to pursue objectives such as the maximization of demand, revenue, profit, or social welfare. We propose a nonlinear optimization approach to fare planning that is based on a detailed discrete choice model of user behavior. The approach allows to analyze different fare structures, optimization objectives, and operational scenarios involving, e.g., subsidies. We use the resulting models to compute optimized fare systems for the city of Potsdam, Germany.",

    author: "Daniel Chemla, Frédéric Meunier, Roberto Wolfler Calvo",
    year: 2013,
    description:
      "This paper deals with a new problem that is a generalization of the many to many pickup and delivery problem and which is motivated by operating self-service bike sharing systems. There is only one commodity, initially distributed among the vertices of a graph, and a capacitated single vehicle aims to redistribute the commodity in order to reach a target distribution. Each vertex can be visited several times and also can be used as a buffer in which the commodity is stored for a later visit. This problem is NP-hard, since it contains several NP-hard problems as special cases (the TSP being maybe the most obvious one). Even finding a tractable exact formulation remains problematic.",

    description:
      "The time complexity of suffix tree construction has been shown to be equivalent to that of sorting: O(n) for a constant-size alphabet or an integer alphabet and O(n log n) for a general alphabet. However, previous algorithms for constructing suffix arrays have the time complexity of O(n log n) even for a constant-size alphabet.",
