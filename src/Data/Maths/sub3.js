    description:
      "As online games become popular and the boundary between virtual and real economies blurs, cheating in games has proliferated in volume and method. In this paper, we propose a framework for user behavior analysis for bot detection in online games. Specifically, we focus on party play which reflects the social activities among gamers: in a Massively Multiuser Online Role Playing Game (MMORPG), party play is a major activity that game bots exploit to keep their characters safe and facilitate the acquisition of cyber assets in a fashion very different from that of normal humans.",

    author: "Shanwen Yang, Tianrui Li, Xun Gong, Bo Peng, Jie Hu",

    description:
      "Crowd simulation has emerged in the last decade as a widely used method of visual effects, computer games, and urban planning, etc. The improvement of hardware performance and the urgent need of special effect lead to an unprecedented wave of crowd simulation studies. This paper reports a review of crowd simulation models from traditional methods to recent methods (e.g. group simulation, emotion contagion). Traditional models can simulate general crowd dynamics which have the advantages of both microscopic and macroscopic models. The recent studies of crowd simulation from group simulation to social psychology crowds are possible to simulate realistic crowds.",
