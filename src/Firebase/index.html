Low-lying structures of clusters (Mg2SiO4)n 2 ≤ n ≤ 13 are determined from a modified minima hopping algorithm using an empirical silicate potential in the Buckingham form.",

      description: "Cryptojacking occurs when an adversary illicitly runs crypto-mining software over the devices of unaware users. This novel cybersecurity attack, that is emerging in both the literature and in the wild, has proved to be very effective given the simplicity of running a crypto-client into a target device. Several countermeasures have recently been proposed, with different features and performance, but all characterized by a host-based architecture.",

Each vertex can be visited several times and also can be used as a buffer in which the commodity is stored for a later visit. This problem is NP-hard, since it contains several NP-hard problems as special cases (the TSP being maybe the most obvious one). Even finding a tractable exact formulation remains problematic.",
