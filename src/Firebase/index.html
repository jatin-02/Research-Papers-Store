Covalent inhibitions can have many advantages from a pharmacokinetic perspective. However, until recently most organisations have shied away from covalent compound design due to fears of non-specific inhibition of off-target proteins leading to toxicity risks.",

We built upon existing interdisciplinary research and augmented it with further analysis on more than 600,000 companies over a 20-year timeframe. The resulting framework is therefore a smart checklist of 21 relevant features that may help investors to select the companies more likely to succeed.",
